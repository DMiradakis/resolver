## Config file

Resolver's config is set in a `resolver.config.json` file. The config file is located in Resolver's install directory for easy access.

Below is a sample `resolver.config.json` file:

```json [resolver.config.json]
{
  "activeProfile": "my-profile",
  "profiles": {
    "my-proile": {
      "projectRootDirectory": "C:\\projects",
      "projectArchiveRootDirectory": "C:\\archive",
      "projectExportRootDirectory": "C:\\exports"
    }
  }
}
```
